Welcome to the online Earth System Modelling / Atmospheric Physics book 
=======================================================================

This book contains a series of interactive python based chapters to support the course Earth System Modelling, although some of the material will also be referred to in Atmospheric Physics.

I wish to acknowledge the input of Brian Rose.  His excellent online course for climate modelling (URL here) was the inspiration for this book, and I've forked the material for Chapters X,Y,Z directly from his book in April 2021, (with his permission of course).  Thanks Brian for making this valuable resouce available.  The other contributions to this course are cited in the introduction to the course handouts.
